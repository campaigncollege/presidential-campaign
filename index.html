        <!--I won't pretend to have all the answers. I'm looking to you to help guide me both before and after the election. I intend for my campaign to be fluid and guided by the good that we can achieve together. And, I promise, that the actions I will take if I am elected President will be dictated by our continued collaboration, and our finest ideas for what is truly best for us all.-->
        
        <h4>Goals for a benevolent government:</h4>

            <li><a href="use-technology/index.html">Use technology effectively to advance civilization.</a></li>
            <li><a href="open-source/index.html">Use the principles of open source to find and solve problems, and guide the operations of the government, quickly and effectively.</a></li>

        </ol><!--The pages for the goals should talk about why these goals are important. The Pages for guiding principles should describe how and why they are needed to bring these almost impossible goals closer to reality.-->
        <p>I believe that we, as a society, can solve <b>any</b> problem that we are <b>truly determined</b> to solve.</p>
