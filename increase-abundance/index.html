              Abundance can free us from toil
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <p>With true abundance we reduce the cost of non-productive members of society, while maximizing the incentive for everyone to create value wherever they can. Struggles and efforts of individuals should be aimed at solving real problems, and helping each other live better lives, not re-solving rudimentary logistics problems pertaining to the distribution of basic staple goods.</p>

          <li>Sustainability is not just a buzz word.
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Sustainability means that we look forward to the future and the repercussions of the actions we take today. We can burn all the fossil fuels we want, as long as we take appropriate measures to prepare ourselves for when they run out, and to repair the damage they do to our environment in the meantime. We need to think about the future, the far future, and that means space. Space based solar power collectors are the real future of energy. Space holds the key to preserving our planet with all it's magnificence, while allowing us to continue to live better and better lives.
