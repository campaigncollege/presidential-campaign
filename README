My name is John Fenley.
I intend to run for President of the united states in 2016.

I believe that we, as a society, can solve any problem we decide to solve.
Our world has many problems, but we are close to being able to solve them if we can work together.

Please help me to usher in a new age of reason governed by our collective intelligence.
