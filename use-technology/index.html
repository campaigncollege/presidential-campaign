          <li>
              We can and should have more robots.
              <ul>
                  <li>Many large civilizations were built and lifted up to their heights in part through the toil and misery brought by the most despicable of all institutions: Slavery. Most of the world has moved on from slavery*, to labor by disenfranchised individuals for a pittance, but we are nearing a new era in which we could finally hand many of the most dangerous, dull, and repetitive, yet necessary tasks, to robots who will work tirelessly, without suffering, on our behalf.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              We can have a true democracy.
              <ul>
                  <li>It is possible to create a platform where all voices can be heard, and all people can make their contribution securely and anonymously known at any time. Government issued ID's and voter cards should have cryptographic capabilities that allow secure signing and hashing of messages.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
