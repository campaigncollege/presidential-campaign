      <p>Many eyes and minds working together, and collaborating effectively, can do amazing things.</p>
      <h4>Making this work for government:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Create a platform where information about problems and situations can be addressed.
              <ul>
                  <li>This is similar to bug tracking in the open source world.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              Collaboratively create a plan to address those issues.
              <ul>
                  <li>Anyone can submit changes to the current plan. Changes filter up through a hierarchy until the problem solved.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              Identify areas of opportunity and future needs.
              <ul>
                  <li>Plan ahead, and take suggestions about what sorts of features will make the next release.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              Test everything to make sure nothing breaks.
              <ul>
                  <li>When a plan is made, we need to know that it is having the intended effect. A change in one place might break other things. It's important to instrument the entire system to monitor it's health both before and after changes. Tests need to be automated and specific, and in this case should act as warnings that things are not going well, or an assurance that things are on track.</li>
              </ul>
