      <h1>Eliminate Suffering as much as is possible</h1>
      <p>I don't suffer much now, but I have in the past. There have been times that I didn't know if I could go on. I know that my experience pales in comparison to what many, if not most, have gone through. We, as a society, owe it to ourselves and to each other, to do as much as we can, to ease and prevent the suffering around us. We should approach these issues and each other with compassion, and when we do, we will see our fellow travelers on this earth as what they are. When we collectively decide that a problem must be solved, we find a way to do it.</p>
      <h4>Making this work for government:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Create a universal fallback baseline below which one cannot fall.
              <ul>
                  <li>The base of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>, comprising: Physiological needs and Safety needs; are simply a matter of logistics, infrastructure, and resource distribution. I believe that every human being deserves to have the things they need to live.
                      <ul>
                          <li>Food to eat.</li>
                          <li>Clean water to drink.</li>
                          <li>Clean air to breathe.</li>
                          <li>Clothing. Optional?</li>
                          <li>A safe, clean place to stay; out of the elements.</li>
                          <li>Sanitation facilities, and toiletries.</li>
                          <li>Access to electricity and information.</li>
                      </ul>
                      There is absolutely no reason to deprive anyone of any of these things. They should be free to all.
                  </li>
                  
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              De-regulate medications
              <ul>
                  <li>Many people suffer because of regulations intended to prevent the abuse of prescription medications. Any barrier at all will prevent at least some who need a drug from receiving it, and inevitably there are some who are punished for breaking a regulation. Everyone should have the opportunity to benefit from modern chemistry. For many people Doctors act as the gatekeepers to this world; De-regulation would both free them to treat more serious cases, and eliminate the cost of a doctors visit for those truly in need.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              Create programs, infrastructure, and best practices to help those in need.
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      This is where things get fuzzy, but I can explain with an example:<br>
                      A person drives out to a bar to have a good time. They have a few too many drinks, and closing time is approaching. When the bar closes they are faced with a dilemma... Their car is parked in the parking lot here, and they want to be home in bed. This is actually a fairly complicated logistics problem, and if you were to imagine that your car were to unexpectedly break down far from home you will begin to understand that we are now asking an impaired individual to solve the same problem. Now imagine that we have solved the problem at the top of the page, and there is a place close by where they can feel secure, and take shelter free of charge (once again, any barrier will prevent some from getting what they need), and sleep it off until morning (or the day after that). How much suffering was prevented? Perhaps there was none. Perhaps a life was saved. When working with large populations, statistics must guide our decisions because even small changes will have real effects on real people.
